;Name:  make_forest_mask_input_image
;
;Purpose:  Take outputs from LandTrendr and from FTV fitting
;   to create a multilayer image that can be used to
;   train a supervised classifier to separate forest from
;   non-forest
;General strategy:  Identify the darkest segment and use it
;    for all of the output.  However, because the interpolation
;    of the FTV images can lead to there being fewer segments
;    in the Greenness and wetness layers, we have to limit
;    the brightness segments to the ones that overlap with
;    greenness and wetness segments.  Eventually, we should
;    constrain the FTV to use the same pixels for interpolation
;    as the original landtrendr run, as this will make all of the
;    outputs more consistent.  But for now, this workaround will work
