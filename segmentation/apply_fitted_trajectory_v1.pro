function apply_fitted_trajectory_v1, all_years, goods, vvals,  $
		  vertices, desawtooth_val


;February 28, 2008
;Given a set of vertices found with TBCD (passed here as "vertices"
;  apply the best fitting trajectory through the vvals (this is
;  presumably a different index or spectral value than the original.


;Years:  the year values that are to be used in the fitting.
; 		These should have the same number of elements as the vvals
;		array.  These should not include years that have clouds
;		or any other filtered values.
;VVals:  The values (spectral, biomass, etc.) for the Years.
;Allyears:  The years for the entire sequence of images, including
;		the years that have been masked out for the fitting.
;		This allows us to build a true fitted image even for
;		years where there's a cloud, etc.



;get the offset of years.  add back in at the end

  ;minimum_x_year = min(years)
  minimum_x_year = min(all_years)

  all_x = all_years - minimum_x_year
  fixed_v = vertices-minimum_x_year

  

   													  ;avoid little dribs and drabs

n_all_yrs = n_elements(all_years)		;how many years are there in the whole archive?
n_yrs = n_elements(vvals)   ;how many years are to be used in this fitting (i.e. minus clouds, etc.)


;Do prep work

;Take out spikes that start and end at same value (to get rid of weird years
;			left over after cloud filtering)

	if desawtooth_val lt 1.0 then $
		vals = desawtooth(vvals, stopat=desawtooth_val) else vals = vvals

;	if n_elements(max_segments) ne 0 then max_count = max_segments+1 else $
;			max_count = min([round(float(n_yrs)/2.5), 7])	;maximum number of vertices is 7

  ;  vals = vals * modifier  ;this sets everything so disturbance is always positive

max_count = n_elements(fixed_v)	;just need this to set segment_mse

;dumb fix

  ; if fixed_v[max_count-1] lt fixed_v[max_count-2] then fixed_v[max_count-2:max_count-1] = [fixed_v[max_count-1], fixed_v[max_count-2]]

                   segment_mse:intarr(max_count-1)-1}


;in the special case where there were not enough to fit,
;   all of the vertices will be -1, and the fixed-vertices -1986.
;  Rather than trip up ftv_v1 with this problem, we just return
;   mean value and

   if vertices[0] eq -1 then begin
		model.vertices[*] = 0
		model.vertices = [0, max(all_x)] + minimum_x_year
		model.vertvals[0:1] = [mean_vvals, mean_vvals]
		model.n_segments = 1
		if n_elements(vvals) gt 2 then $
			model.segment_mse =  fix(stdev(vvals) < 32767) else model.segment_mse = fix(total(mean_vvals^2) < 32767)	;just square it to make it look bad.
        ;fyit is already set right
        return, {ok:1, model:model}
