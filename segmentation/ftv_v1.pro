;The best trace is the set of y-values that best
;    works with those vertices.  This approach
;    uses find_best_trace, which uses a simple
;    and relatively quick way to do this.  Starting
;    at the left of the sequence, it allows segments
;    to either track the two vertices directly,
;    or to use a simple linear least-squares value
;    anchored on the left vertex to connect to the
;    next vertex.  This forces the sequence in order
;    from left to right (oldest to newest).
